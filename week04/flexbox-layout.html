<!--
Flex containers and flex items: The container is the parent and has the display: flex; declaration. The items are the direct children of the container and can be manipulated using various flex properties.
Flex direction: The flex-direction property defines the direction in which the flex items are placed in the flex container. It can be set to row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse.
Justify content: The justify-content property aligns the flex items along the main axis (horizontally in a row, vertically in a column). It can be set to values like flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, or space-around.
Align items: The align-items property aligns the flex items along the cross axis (vertically in a row, horizontally in a column). It can be set to values like flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, or stretch.
Place items: The place-items property is a shorthand for align-items and justify-items. It can be used to control the alignment of items within a grid container.
