        <p>Hello! My name is Rafael Mendoza and I am living in Texas, USA. I enjoy baking and
            playing video games. I am currently studying Software Development at BYU Idaho.
            I am excited to learn more about web development as I continue this course. I am looking
            forward to creating my own website and learning about the industry so that
            I am help apply it into my job today. I'm excited to see what future opportunities this
            can bring to me.</p>
