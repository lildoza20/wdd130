            <h2> History </h2>
            <p>A little about White Water Rafting... We've been in business for over 20 years,
                serving the community. We started our company with a dad wanting to just get out on
                the water, he felt peace when he was out there despite the rapids. In doing so, he
                felt he could make a change in a lot of lives, due to the peace from the water. As
                well as the skills that he would provide the younger generation in learning from
                working as a team and experiencing the joy of the rapids.</p>
